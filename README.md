# Ski Run Open Twitter Bot

A service that tweets whenever a ski run at Solitude ski resort in Salt Lake City with at least a black diamond rating changes from closed to open on their website.


# Current Status
Twitter is a chaotic organization that has taken more than two weeks to review my developer account application. As such, I've not been able to deploy this bot.
